## Installation
1. Install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) for your browser (or any other style manager capable of dealing with UserCSS)
2. Open [style page]() - Stylus (or whatever you've installed) should open the installation page
3. Be happy with the theme or install [extra fonts]()

## Features
- Dark, clean style without extra shadows or borders
- Syntax highlihting inspired by [ayu theme](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu)

## Known issues
- Contribution feed looks awful (can't be fixed with CSS-only, I'll make a script for that)
- Some pages (e.g. [this](https://github.com/explore)) still have wrong colors. If you find something like this, please fill an issue

## Extra fonts
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't allow importing fonts, so this styles relies on default GitHub fonts.
Still, style can use two extra fonts: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for monospace and [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for everything else. 
Install those on your device to get a nicer appearance.

## Screenshots
I will add those later
